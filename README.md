# Cody Thayer

**`Data Analyst | M.S. Data Science Candidate at Boston University`**

*My journey into data science began at UC San Diego with an elective C++ introductory course and has since evolved into a deep-seated passion for leveraging Python, TensorFlow, and other cutting-edge technologies to solve complex, real-world problems. I've grown from automating Excel tasks to building sophisticated algorithms and data models. A notable achievement includes developing a convolutional neural network with a 93% accuracy rate for geological image classification. Although I have mostly been a self-taught programmer, Boston University is fueling my ambition to not only refine my self-taught skills with formal education but also to explore the possibility of furthering my education with a doctorate. My goal is to use my data science expertise to make a tangible impact in whatever field or job I find myself. I look forward to applying my diverse skills and experiences in an environment that appreciates innovation, creative problem-solving, and enthusiasm.*
